  <img src="Semey.jpg" alt=“Semey” width=“100” height=“50”>

<h3> I would like to start from its short history </h3>

<p> What do people imagine when they hear Semey? </p>
<p style="border-width:2px; border-style:solid; border-color: #99ccff; padding: 1em;"> Motherland of poets and writers as Abay, Shakarim, Auezov. Horrific nuclear bomb testings by the Soviets at Kurchatov polygon.
City of our independence.
Semey's history as a settlement started in 1718 when Tsarist Russia built the Semipalatinsk fortress.
  The fortress, which emerged as a border and military support base, became an important trade point between
  Central Asia, Russia and Western China bringing different people to the city. The emergence of which is
  inextricably linked with the history of Kazakhstan's colonization by Russian Empire.
   Between 1917 and 1920, the city operated as the capital of the Alash Autonomy.
 The city was a capital of most political activities of the state. </p>

<h3> What about must-go places in the city? </h3>
<p style="border-width:2px; border-style:solid; border-color: #99ccff; padding: 1em;">
  Long and interesting history makes the city interesting and full of places with historical meaning. I have created
a big list on the must-go places starting from the museums and ending with the restaraunts and shops. </p>
