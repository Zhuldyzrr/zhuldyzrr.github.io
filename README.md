My website has a navigation that can be squeezed and easily used. 

My page has numerous links to external files to give a broader picture of who I am.

All links can be used to navigate to another page. 

I have cute but not too-much animations.

Summary section is also clickable. 

An interesting thing that I have managed to add is the vertical timeline for my resume. Which is also adjustable to different sizes. 

The clearest visualization of the image’s change is on the page “Certificate”. 
Other pictures do change but the change is not that big.
