      <p>On this page I wish to share my feelings about some positions I hold. The broader list of all working experience I had is available by the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vG9GsibSkWQ6J2lSFNn0hBq65W4vBrUe/view?usp=sharing" title="Free Website Templates">link</a>. </p>
      <p>As a student with a future degree in international relations, I went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan to get some experience. Indeed, it was an interesting experience. My internship was not limited by sorting papers, instead I was writing papers myself and talked to many ambassadors myself. My instructor trusted me responsible tasks as I proved that I am worthy. At the end of my internship I was offered to work at the Ministry and the Embassy of Korea. Unfortunately, I needed to refuse as I could not quit my studies. </p>
      <p>Being a research assistant was a worthy experience. Since August 2021 I was fortunate to be a research assistant for two professors and in one <a href="https://www.coronanet-project.org/">international project.</a> </p>
      <p> Working as a trainer for the indepdent elections' observers was the most responsible work I had. I was responsible for the knowledge of 100 people who attended my courses on elections' observation.</p>
