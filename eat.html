<h2 style="color:#99ccff;"> Guide to Semey restaraunts </h2>
<h3><li> Selfie </h3>
  <p> They cook the best meat in the city, their steaks are million out of 10. </p>

<h3><li> Fusion </h3>
  <p> I adore everything they have on their menu. Chicken, beef,
  horse meat, shrimps, salmon, everything is very delicious.
<br> Oh, and especially their desserts...They are the reason I am a circle when I am in Semey. </br> </p>

<h3><li> Terrasse </h3>
  <p> I am a big fan of shashlik and they cook the best shashlik in the city. Perfect match. </p>

<h3><li> Atmosphera </h3>
  <p> If you are thinking about the place to go with a company, have some drink and enjoy pretty music - visit Atmosphera. </p>

<h3><li> Global coffee </h3>
  <p> I have added this place because it is perfect to drink coffee, study and just relax in silence. </p>

  <h3><li> Blinok </h3>
    <p> This place is not fancy at all. You cannot sit and enjoy your food properly.
    <br> BUT this is the place every Semey citizen adores. </br>
    <br> They cook the best pancakes I have ever eaten in my life. </br> </p>

<h3><li> Smak </h3>
  <p> It is a canteen in the city centre where I go when I have only 5 minutes to eat </p>

<h3><li> Brownies </h3>
  <p> They cook the best ramen in the city. In general, they are the best in Japanese cuisine for sure. </p>
